## Project Overview
 
As part of the Bright Network Technology Academy, we were assigned a collaborative project where the team was to demonstrate the ability to use an existing API.

## About The Project:
#### A nail-biting fantasy adventure, in a world full of dangerous creatures:

<p>

The great knight has been summoned to journey through deep forests, deadly mountains and monster infested caves, to defeat the mighty troll of Tarragon. </p>

*But beware! - You will be entering rival territories...* 
  
## Setup & Instructions
  
1. Clone repo link -> https://github.com/IsratAhmed/Adventure_Game.git

**Backend - API**

2. Once the repository has been cloned, open the *'backend'* folder in Visual Studio code (VSC) + run it.

**Frontend - Frontend App**

3. Open the *'Adventure_game'* folder in terminal -> type the command: 'npm install' or (npm i)
4. Once that has run, type the command: 'code .' to open in Visual Studio code (VSC)
5. In Visual Studio code (VSC) built in terminal, type the following commands:

- npm install react-router-dom@6
- npm install react-icons
- npm install styled-components

6. Once the packages have been installed, open the react app in browser using the command: 'npm start'

*Note - the frontend app should run on ‘localhost:3000’ unless you have another application running on this port - if so, you will be prompted to use another port option i.e. localhost:3001. This will not affect the running of the project.
